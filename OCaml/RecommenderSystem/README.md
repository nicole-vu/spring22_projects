Recommender systems are systems that can make recommendation for users, for example, a movie that the user would enjoy watching.  In this project, we'll constructe a simple recommender system.

The basic idea behind recommender systems is that a collection of *users* each contribute some sort of *rating* (e.g., "like"/"don't like", "upvote"/"downvote", "10 out of 10"...) on some *items* from a collection.  Then using these ratings the system tries to either find users who have similar ratings on many items (user/user similarity) or items that have similar ratings from many users (item/item similarity).  In the second case, the idea is that if many users had a similar opinion of both items, then they must have something in common.  We'll build an application that uses item/item similarity to find other items similar to a given item.
